# Computer Networks Practice Tasks

This repository contains practice tasks for Computer Networks studied during university, covering Packet Tracer labs, CLI exercises, and Python network programming.

It **includes only the Word documents** created by me with step-by-step instructions for completing the tasks. All original source files and lab exercises have been removed due to licensing restrictions.

## Topics covered

- **Packet Tracer & Network Simulation 🖥️**: exploring network devices, configuring switches and routers, VLANs, IPv4/IPv6 addressing  
- **CLI & IOS Commands 💻**: navigation, initial device configuration, ARP/ICMP analysis, routing table inspection  
- **ARP & ICMP Analysis 🌐**: viewing and modifying ARP cache, capturing ARP/ICMP packets with Wireshark, measuring RTT  
- **Routing & Subnetting 🛣️**: static routes, default routes, floating static routes, RIPv2, OSPFv2, convergence analysis  
- **VLAN & Inter-VLAN Routing 🔀**: VLAN creation, router-on-a-stick configuration, troubleshooting  
- **DNS & DHCP 🧭**: capturing and analyzing DNS requests/responses, DHCP server configuration  
- **Python Network Programming 🐍**: UDP client-server interaction, RTT calculation, timeout handling
