# Assembly & C++ Practice Labs

This repository contains practice exercises in **x86-64 Assembly** and **C++**, aimed at developing skills in low-level programming, numerical computations, and performance optimization.

## Topics covered
- **Basic Operations 🛠️:** arithmetic, bitwise, and logical operations; working with integers and floating-point numbers
- **Control Structures 🔧:** loops, conditional statements, and boolean logic
- **Arrays & Data Sequences 📊:** manipulation of one- and two-dimensional arrays, sorting, summation, and element-wise operations
- **Functions & Modular Design 🏗️:** defining and calling functions, using parameters and return values, modular approach to computations
- **Numerical Computations & Vectorization 🎯:** evaluating mathematical functions, polynomials, and vector operations using standard C++ and SIMD instructions (SSE/AVX)
- **Performance Analysis ⏱️:** measuring execution time, comparing regular and optimized implementations, studying memory access patterns and cache behavior
- **Data Visualization & Analysis 📈:** organizing results, processing measurements, and generating visual representations to interpret performance

## Key Highlights
- Provides a comprehensive view of programming at both high-level (C++) and low-level (Assembly)
- Emphasizes efficient computation and optimization techniques
- Integrates theoretical understanding with practical implementation and benchmarking
